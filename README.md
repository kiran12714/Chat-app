# Project Introduction
Welcome to the presentation of our modern messaging
application prototype. I have designed and developed a 
feature-rich messaging platform that caters to both individual
and group communication needs. In this presentation, we will
walk through the core features, design principles, technology
stack, and instructions for setting up and running our prototype.

# Core Features

Authenticaton
 
Real Time Chatting with Typing indicators

One to One chat

Search Users

Create Group Chats

Notifications

Add or Remove users from group

View Other user Profile

# Design Principles

CLEAN AND INTUITIVE USER INTERFACE

RESPONSIVE DESIGN

# Technology Stack

**Frontend:** React.js, React Router for navigation.

**Backend:** Node.js for the server.

**Database:** MongoDB for data storage with encryption.

**Real-time communication:** WebSocket using Socket.io for real-time message updates.

**Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication and data encryption.

**Password handling:** Bcrypt for securely decoding and verifying user credentials.

# Why We Choose This Technology Stack ?

**REACT:**

Component-based UI: React.js promotes modularity and reusability in UI development, which is useful for building complex interfaces like messaging applications.

Virtual DOM: For efficient rendering updates, resulting in a smooth user experience in real-time applications.

**NODE:**

 Non-blocking, event-driven: Node.js's non-blocking, event-driven architecture for handling concurrent connections efficiently.

JavaScript on both sides: Using JavaScript both on the frontend and backend allows for easier code sharing and better developer collaboration.

npm (Node Package Manager): npm provides access to a wealth of pre-built packages, making it easier to manage dependencies.

**MONGODB:**

NoSQL for flexibility: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that excels at handling unstructured or semi-structured data, making it suitable for the dynamic nature of chat applications where message structures can vary.

Scalability: MongoDB's horizontal scalability and sharding capabilities allow us to handle growing data volumes efficiently.

Real-time updates: MongoDB's support for change streams enables real-time updates, a critical feature for instant message delivery.


**SOCKET.IO:**

 Real-time capabilities: Socket.io is designed for real-time, bidirectional communication, which is essential for features like instant message delivery, typing indicators, and read receipts.

**JSON WEB TOKENS:**

Stateless authentication: JWTs provide stateless authentication, which is crucial for a distributed, scalable application like ours.

Data encryption: Used to encrypt sensitive data, enhancing security and ensuring user privacy.

**BCRYPT:**

Password security: bcrypt is a robust password hashing algorithm that helps protect user credentials by securely hashing and verifying passwords.

# Setup and Run Locally

  cd frontend/
  
  npm install
  
**Start the server:**

  npm run start
  
**Start the Client:**

  //open now terminal
  
  cd frontend
  
  npm start


# Conclusion

OUR MODERN MESSAGING APPLICATION PROTOTYPE COMBINES CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGIES
WITH A CLEAN, INTUITIVE DESIGN TO PROVIDE USERS WITH A SEAMLESS COMMUNICATION
EXPERIENCE. WHETHER IT'S INDIVIDUAL CHATS, GROUP CONVERSATIONS, OR VIDEO CALLS, OUR
PLATFORM IS DESIGNED TO MEET DIVERSE COMMUNICATION NEEDS. I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR
FEEDBACK. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, AND CONTRIBUTION.

# My Experience

MY EXPERIENCE IN THE PROJECT SELECTION ROUND HAS BEEN TRULY ENJOYABLE. BUILDING THIS
PROJECT HAS ALLOWED ME TO EXPLORE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND IMMERSE MYSELF IN THE WORLD
OF MINDWREN, YOUR MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTING PROJECT.
WHETHER I PROCEED TO THE NEXT ROUND OR NOT, I WANT TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO
IMBESIDEYOU COMPANY. THIS JOURNEY HAS BEEN A VALUABLE LEARNING EXPERIENCE AND
ENJOYABLE WHICH IS MOST IMPORTANT FOR MENTAL HEALTH. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY,
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT LIES AHEAD.
